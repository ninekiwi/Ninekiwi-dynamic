                                <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #ade6ff; line-height: 1.6;">
                                    In construction and civil engineering, "General Notes" refer to the section in a project documentation where the essential information, instructions, and guidelines that are not covered in the detailed drawings or specifications are recorded. These notes often include administrative details, references to standards and codes, and general instructions for the contractor.
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #ade6ff; line-height: 1.6;">
                                    The General Notes section should include instructions regarding compliance with local building codes, material storage guidelines, site access restrictions, and any other considerations that must be adhered to during construction. This ensures all parties are aware of the overarching requirements for the project.
                                </p>

                                <p style="font-family: Arial, serif; color: #ade6ff; line-height: 1.6;">
                                    Tenant Protection Inspection is a process used in construction, particularly in renovation projects within occupied buildings, to ensure that tenants' safety and well-being are protected during the construction activities. This inspection focuses on preventing disruptions and hazards that could affect the tenants.
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #ade6ff; line-height: 1.6;">
                                    Tenant Protection Inspection involves assessing the site to ensure that all necessary safety measures are in place to protect tenants from construction hazards. This includes installing barriers to reduce noise and dust, ensuring that emergency exits remain accessible, and providing tenants with timely updates about the construction progress.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #ade6ff; line-height: 1.6;">
                                    In civil engineering, a survey refers to the process of collecting and analyzing data about a construction site. Surveys are used to measure and map out the physical characteristics of the site, which are crucial for planning and executing the construction project.
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #ade6ff; line-height: 1.6;">
                                    A survey provides critical information about the construction site, including its topography, boundaries, and existing structures. Accurate survey data ensures that the construction plan is feasible and aligns with the site's characteristics, minimizing the risk of errors during construction.
                                </p>
